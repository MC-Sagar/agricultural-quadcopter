The spraying mechanism is made with a bottle which has a big enough cap to fit the DC motor inside the bottle. The DC motor is fitted with a pipe which comes out of the bottle cap and the nozzle is fitted to the pipe. The DC motor is connected to a push button switch and 9V Battery. A servo motor is used to click on the switch which will inturn power up the DC motor. The servo motor is controlled by a transmitter and it is connected to one of the reciever's channel.
